# About
This directory contains all code implementation and hardware designs for Polaris.

# Overview
We present Polaris, the first vision-free fiducial marking system, based on a novel, full-stack magnetic sensing design. 
Polaris can achieve reliable and accurate pose estimation and contextual perception, even in NLOS scenarios. 

Its core design includes: (1) a novel digital modulation scheme, Magnetic Orientation-shift Keying (MOSK) that can encode key information like waypoints and coordinates with passive magnets; (2) a robust and lightweight magnetic sensing framework to decode and localize the magnetic tags. 
Our design also equips Polaris with three key features: sufficient encoding capacity, robust detection accuracy, and low energy consumption. 
We have built an end-to-end system of Polaris and tested it extensively in real-world scenarios. The testing results have shown Polaris to achieve an accuracy of up to 0.58 mm and 1&deg; in posture estimation with a power consumption of only 25.08 mW.

# Setup
To use Polaris, the following steps are required:
* [Building the hardware](#building-the-hardware)
* [Programing the sensor array](#programing-the-sensor-array)
* [Tag fabrication](#tag-fabrication)
* [Running the sensing pipeline](#running-the-sensing-pipeline)

## Building the hardware
We provide the hardware requirements and manufacturing details of Polaris' sensing array in `/PCBs`, please see the related [README](./PCBs/README.md) file.

## Programing the sensor array
We use the Arduino IDE to program the sensor array according to the hardware specifications.
### Arduino IDE setup
1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). For our prototype, we are using Version 1.8.19.
2. Configure the Arduino IDE for the nRF52 Development Board by following the [official instruction](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/arduino-bsp-setup).
After setup, you can access the board information by clicking on the 'Tools' menu.

3. Install the Adafruit MLX90393 Library for the Arduino IDE:
    - Click 'Sketch' --> 'Include Library' --> 'Manage Libraries...'
    ![plot](./Imgs/sensor_arduino_library.png)
    - Search for Adafruit MLX90393, and install the Adafruit MLX90393 library:

### Programing setup
To program the sensor array using the hardware and Arduino IDE, follow these steps:
1. The microcontroller unit (MCU) in use is the MDBT42Q-512KV2 module, which features a Nordic nRF52832 chip. Since the module is equipped with a blank chip, it needs to be programmed using a J-Link programmer during the initial setup. Please note that this programming step is only required once for a new sensor array.
    - In our prototype, we use a [J-Link EDU Mini](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/j-link-edu-mini/) for programming, one can follow the following hardware setup:
    ![plot](./Imgs/JLink_hardware_setup.jpg)
    - Open the Arduino IDE --> Click 'Tools' --> Click 'Programmer' --> Choose 'J-Link for Bluefruit nRF52'
    ![plot](./Imgs/JLink_step2.png)
    - Click 'Tools' --> Click 'Burn Bootloader'. When you see the following messages, it indicates that the MCU has been programmed successfully.

2. After programming the MCU, you can disconnect the J-Link module and use the Arduino IDE to upload the code that activates the magnetometer readings.
    - Setup the flashing module and the target sensor array and connect to your PC.Make sure the 'Board,' 'Port,' and 'Programmer' settings in the Arduino IDE's 'Tools' menu are properly configured

    - Select the sensing code from the '/Arduino' directory. Both BLE and wired data transmission codes are available for various tasks. Please refer to the relevant file
    - Upload the corresponding Arduino code to the sensor array using the Arduino IDE
    ![plot](./Imgs/flashing_result.png)

3. After successfully programming the Arduino code to the sensor array, you can use the Python code in the '/Read_Raw_Sensor' directory to read the raw sensor data.

## Tag fabrication
In our protetype, we use an ultra-thin and durable PVC plane with 
a thickness of 0.2 mm as the substrate and Neodymium (NdFeB) magnets.
To fabricate the tag, we propose a four-step process. 
For more details, please see Sec.7.2 in the paper.

## Running the sensing pipeline
Once the sensor array is programmed, you can run the Polaris' sensing pipeline. You can find the sensing code in the `/Sensing_Pipeline` directory, please see the related [README](./Sensing_Pipeline/README.md) file.



# Getting started with Polaris
